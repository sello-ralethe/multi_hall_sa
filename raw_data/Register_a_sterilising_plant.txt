==================================================

To operate a sterilising plant, you must register it in terms of the Fertilizers, Farm Feeds, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act, 1947 (Act 36 of 1947). A sterilising plant is used for sterilising animal products from any vertebrate or invertebrate specified by the Minister.

To qualify:

Once the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 has received your application form and the inspection reports, an inspector from Act 36 of 1947 will inspect sterilising plant to assess whether it complies with the requirements of the Act and its  regulations.

If the Registrar is satisfied with the inspection, the plant will be registered and the certificate issued. The Sterilising Plant Certificate is valid for three years. You must apply for renewal by 31 March in the year that the registration expires.

Note: The Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 will cancel your registration any time if:

It takes up to four months.
