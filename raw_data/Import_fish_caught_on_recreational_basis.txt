==================================================

To import fish, such as marine fish, that you caught during a holiday in another country, you must apply for a permit from the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment. You cannot sell the imported fish but you can use it for personal consumption.

You must apply at least two weeks prior to your departure to allow for processing. You cannot bring fish into South Africa without the import permit. You do not need a permit for bait; however, please ensure that you have in your possession either a recreational bait permit (only the daily bag limit can be transported) or a cash slip for bait purchased.

The following restrictions apply:

Note: The recreational import permit excludes freshwater fish. Failure to adhere to permit conditions may result in the suspension or cancellation of the permit.

It may take seven working days or more, subject to proper lodging of the application.
