==================================================

Petroleum products are subject to import/export control and therefore a company or an individual that intends importing or exporting petroleum products into or out of South Africa requires an import or export permit.

The issuing of petroleum import and export permits is subject to requirements administered by theDepartment of Energy (DoE).

To be considered for authorisation, you must contact the department regarding the required procedure. Goods such as crude oil, fuel, paraffin, lubricating oils, petroleum gases, petroleum jelly, petroleum bitumen and paraffin wax are subject to import and export control measures.

Note: Import permits are valid for 12 and export permits for six months.

The turnaround time for the issuing of import permits is three working days.

ITAC does not charge service fees but you will have to pay customs duty to the South African Revenue Service (Sars). Customs duty is calculated as a percentage of the value of the goods (set in the schedules to the Customs and Excise Act). For more information on Sars customs duty, visit theSars website.
