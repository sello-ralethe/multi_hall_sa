==================================================

You are required by law to register with the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) and contribute towards the fund if you have employed people for more than 24 hours per month.

The monthly contribution for UIF is two percent of your worker's gross salary per month. You must deduct one percent of your worker's gross salary per month and you as the employer contributes one percent.
