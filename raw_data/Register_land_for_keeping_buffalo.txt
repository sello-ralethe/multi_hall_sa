==================================================

If you wish to keep buffalo, you must register the land with the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development.

You must first obtain permission from the relevant nature conservation authorities of the province.

The time frame for approval of the application by the provincial veterinary authorities varies from one province to the next.

Once the Directorate: Animal Health has received the application the registration process may take approximately ten working days.

The cost of the service will differ, depending on the province involved.
