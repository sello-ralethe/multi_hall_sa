For your civil society organisation to be recognised as a legal entity, you must register it as a non-profit company (NPC) with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC).

NPCs are entities that are set up to help people, protect the environment or to lobby for some good cause. They could include churches, charity organisations and cultural organisations. The primary objective of an NPC is to benefit the public, not to make profit.
