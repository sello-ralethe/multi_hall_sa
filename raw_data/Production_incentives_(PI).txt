==================================================

The Production Incentive (PI) forms part of the overall Clothing and Textile Competitiveness Programme (CTCP). It flows from the implementation, by theDepartment of Trade, Industry and Competition, of customised sector programmes (CSPs) for the clothing, textiles, footwear, leather and leather goods industries.

The Production Incentive Guidelines seek to enable companies to present their business cases to the CTCP Desk of the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). They also provide a framework for the CTCP Desk to evaluate such cases.

You can use the full benefit as either an upgrade grant facility or an interest subsidy facility, or a combination of both.

Find out more about the programme from theDepartment of Trade, Industry and Competition.
