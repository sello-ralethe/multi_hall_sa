==================================================

If you want to import fresh (raw) meat (including offal) into the Republic of South Africa, or move such meat in transit through the country, legislation requires you to apply for and be granted a veterinary import permit or in transit permit from the Director: Animal Health. You must obtain this permit before the consignment leaves the exporting country.

Veterinary import permits are valid for a limited period and for one consignment only. Imports via third countries are generally not accepted.

The Director of Animal Health of South Africa will only issue veterinary import or in transit permits for fresh (raw) meat for countries where he/she has evaluated and approved the veterinary services and animal health status. (Information available fromElmarieV@daff.gov.za, tel. 012 319 7700 or fax 012 329 6892.)

There are import protocols in place that are specific to individual countries based on the products and the animal health situation there. As the health requirements change often, please contact the Directorate: Animal Health (tel: 012 319 7420 /7524 /7700, fax 012 329 6892) to obtain the latest requirements.

It is your responsibility as the importer to read and comply with the conditions on the veterinary import permit.

In terms of the Meat Safety Act, 2000 (Act 40 of 2000) frozen and chilled meat may only be imported from abattoirs, cutting and meat preparation plants that have been approved by the National Executive Officer of South Africa.

A list of approved establishments can be obtained from the Directorate: Animal Health or call 012 319 7700 or fax a request to 012 329 6892.

Meat consignments imported from overseas via the sea route may only be imported in reefer containers. No break bulk consignments will be accepted. Fresh (raw) meat may only be imported if chilled or frozen at the temperatures stipulated in the veterinary import permit.

Once the state veterinarian at the national office has approved the importation, it takes three to five working days to process the application and issue the permit.
