==================================================

You should apply for subsistence and small-scale fishing exemption if you live in a coastal community and want to make use of marine living resources.

You must apply through the locally established local co-management committees.

To qualify for the exemption, you must meet all the verification criteria.

Note: It is unlawful to engage in subsistence and small-scale fishing without a permit. Currently subsistence and small-scale fishers are managed by fishing exemptions until the finalisation of the small-scale fisheries policy.

The exemption is renewable annually. Before issuing exemptions departmental staff explain exemption conditions and bag limits.

Failure to adhere to exemption conditions may result in legal proceedings which include suspension, cancellation or the revocation of the exemption.

The application process may take a month or more depending on the volume of applications.

Departmental officials will call a community meeting to issue exemptions to all registered fishers.
