==================================================

If you want to import live animals, animal products, infectious or contagious things into the Republic of South Africa, you must apply for a veterinary import permit from the Director: Animal Health. You must obtain this permit before the animal or product is shipped from the exporting country.If you are importing live farm animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, ostriches, poultry (not cats and dogs) or the genetic material of these animals, you must get authorisation from the Registrar of Animal Improvement before a veterinary import permit can be issued.  For enquiries regarding animal improvement authorisations please phone 012 319 7434 or 012 319 7424.There are import protocols in place for animals and animal products. The health requirements change often, therefore please contact the Import Export Policy Unit of the Directorate: Animal Health (fax 012 329 6892 or e-mailVetPermits@daff.gov.za) to obtain the latest requirements.  There might be other legislation in place for specific products and you must make sure that you meet all legal requirements.

Once the state veterinarian at the national office has approved the importation, it takes three to five working days to process the application and issue the permit.
