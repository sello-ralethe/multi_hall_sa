==================================================

You may only import, distribute or sell vaccines for use in animals in South Africa once the vaccines have been registered in terms of the Fertilizers, Farms Feeds, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act, 1947 (Act 36 of 1947).If you want to import a registered vaccine for use in animals, you must also obtain a veterinary import permit from the Directorate: Animal Health. This import permit is valid for a limited period and for one consignment only. There are veterinary import protocols in place. Because the health requirements change often, please contact the Directorate: Animal Health (tel 012 319 7507/7684/7700/7673/7456 or fax 012 329 6892 or e-mailVetPermits@daff.gov.za) to obtain the latest requirements.If you want to import an unregistered vaccine for a trial in South Africa, you need two permits. One permit must be obtained from the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 and the other from the Directorate: Animal Health. The application for the permit from the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 must be accompanied by the complete proposed trial protocol.The Directorate: Animal Health issues an import permit only once it receives a copy of the permit issued by the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947.

A vaccine imported for a trial may not be sold.

In an emergency situation where an outbreak of a disease occurs and no registered vaccine is available in the country, it may be a necessary to use an unregistered vaccine. In that case you, as a prospective importer, must apply to the Medicines Control Council  for a Section 21 exemption in terms of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act (Act 101 of 1965, as amended by Act 90 of 1997). You also need an import permit from the Directorate: Animal Health for the vaccine to enter the country. This import permit is issued only once you have obtained approval from and submitted proof to the Medicines Control Council. In this case, the unregistered vaccine may be sold for a limited period until registration has been obtained.

Note: No application will be processed without proof of payment. Proof of the deposit must be e-mailed toVetPermits@daff.gov.zaor faxed to 012 329 8292.

Once the state seterinarian at the national office has approved the importation, it takes three to five working days to process the application and issue the veterinary import permit.
