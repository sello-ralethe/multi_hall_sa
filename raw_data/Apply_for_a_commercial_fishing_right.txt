==================================================

To harvest fish or engage in a fishing-related activity for commercial purposes, you must first be in possession of a commercial fishing right. You can only apply for a commercial fishing right upon invitation in the Government Gazette when long-term commercial fishing rights are given to individuals and companies for a period of eight to fifteen years.

The invitation published in the Government Gazette will contain information on the distribution point where you can collect an application form. You must pay a non-refundable prescribed fee as specified by the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries in the Gazette.

Note: No person may engage in commercial fishing without a permit. In addition to the permit, you will also require a permit to transport fish.
