==================================================

If you own cattle, sheep, goats or pigs, it is compulsory that you mark your livestock. You must apply for a registered identification mark at the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development.

An animal identification mark shows to whom the animal belongs. If the animal is lost or stolen and is found, it will be possible to trace the owner.

An identification mark consists of not more than three letters of the alphabet or symbols (characters).

Permanent identification marks can be put on animals by means of hot iron branding, freeze branding or tattooing.

If you buy animals or receive them as a gift, you must put an identification mark on them within two weeks. Animals that you sell should also carry your identification mark.

Your mark is put on the National Register of Animal Identification System (AIS) and no one may use it or brand your animal without your permission.

Note: You may not put an identification mark on your animals if you have not registered the identification mark.
