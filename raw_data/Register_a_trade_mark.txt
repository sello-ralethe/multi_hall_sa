==================================================

Register your trade mark with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC), to prevent your competitors from using it. CIPC administers the Register of Trade Marks, which is the official record of all the trade marks that have formally been applied for and/or registered in the Republic of South Africa, since 1916.

Applications can be lodged in 45 different classes, depending on the goods and/or services for which the trade mark will be used. Details of the international classification system, the Nice Classification System, can be obtained on theWorld Intellectual Property Organisation's website. A registered trade mark can be protected forever, provided you renew the registration every ten years.
