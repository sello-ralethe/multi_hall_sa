==================================================

Copyright is secured automatically when you create an original work that people can see or hear such as a book, painting or music. Most works eligible for copyright protection do not require registration or other formalities, except for cinematograph films.

You can create your own copyright by putting the words “copyright” or “copyright reserved” or the internationally recognised copyright symbol followed by your name and the year e.g. © Baloyi 2011 on your original work.

However, if you want to have a copyright in a film, DVD or video, you must apply to the Registrar of Copyright on prescribed forms.
