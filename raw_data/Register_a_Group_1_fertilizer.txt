==================================================

To manufacture or sell a Group 1 fertilizer, you must register it with the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947. Group 1 fertilizers contain more than 100 g/kg of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or potassium (K) as the main ingredients. They are also known as inorganic fertilizers.

You must have a legal office in South Africa or be a juristic person with an office in South Africa to apply for registration.

If the fertilizer you want to register has already been registered by another person, you must get written permission from that individual before registration.

You must send the fertilizer to an accredited laboratory before submitting your application. The laboratory will evaluate and test the fertilizer and give you a certificate. You must attach the certificate of analysis to your application. The Registrar will not accept your application without a certificate of analysis from an accredited laboratory.

Note: You must renew your registration every three years before 31 December.

Three to six months.
