==================================================

A registered trade union may authorise a picket by its members and supporters for the purposes of peaceful demonstration.

A picket may be held in any place to which the public has access. It can be held outside the premises or inside with the permission from the employer.

If there is a dispute on picketing rules, a registered trade union or the employer can request the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to secure an agreement between the parties.

If there is no agreement reached, the CCMA must establish the picketing rules, taking into account the particular circumstances of the workplace or other premises for picketing and any relevant code of good practice.
