==================================================

The South African government implemented a Business Process Outsourcing and Offshoring (BPO&O) incentive programme in July 2007. Between July 2007 and March 2010, the incentive resulted in the creation of at least 6 000 new jobs and attracted R303 million in direct investments. The BPS aims to attract investment and create employment in South Africa through off-shoring activities.
