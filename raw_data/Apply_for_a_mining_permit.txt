==================================================

If you want to conduct mining operations you need to obtain a mining permit from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE).

No person is allowed to mine without a mining permit.

Mining permits are not transferable. They are aimed at controlling prospecting and mining, having regard to considerations for health and safety, environmental management and the responsible extraction of minerals.

A mining permit is valid for the period specified on the permit, but may not exceed two years. It may however be renewed for three more periods of no more than a year each.

A mining permit may only be issued if:

The South African Mineral Resources Administration System will inform you immediately if your application has been accepted (this means you have met all the requirements).

Contact the Department of Mineral Resources about the costs.
