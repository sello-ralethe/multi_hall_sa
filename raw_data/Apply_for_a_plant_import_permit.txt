==================================================

To import plants, plant products and other regulated articles to South Africa you must apply for an import permit issued by the National Plant Protection Organisation of South Africa (NPPOZA). The permit is valid for a year.

You must meet the phytosanitary import conditions of the Agricultural Pests Act, 1983 (Act 36 of 1983) or the National Plant Protection Organisation of South Africa (NPPOZA).

If products are not exempted from the import permit, you must complete an application form to import the products. If the products are exempted, you must ensure that they comply with phytosanitary measures for such exemption.

You must send a copy of the import permit to the exporter/supplier. The National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) of the exporting country must check if the products meet the import requirements of South Africa.

If import requirements are met, the NPPO will issue a phytosanitary certificate. The exporter must send the original phytosanitary certificate with the goods to South Africa.

It might take one to 30 days to process your application.
