==================================================

You may only export animals or animal products if they come from premises that comply with international standards or the legislation of the importing country. These premises could be an approved abattoir, quarantine station, artificial insemination centre, embryo collection centre, farm, feedlot, food processing factory, food storage premises, etc.

The time taken for registration to be finalised varies from province to province.

This depends on the province where the premises are located.

Forms can be obtained from the provincial state veterinarian or the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development.
