==================================================

You must apply to renew or cancel your agricultural remedy registration every three years. You must submit your application to the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947 at the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development before the 31st of March of the year in which your registration cycle lapses.

If the agricultural remedy that you want to renew has already been registered by another person, you must get permission from that individual before renewal.

You must package the remedy in a clean and closed container. You are not allowed to re-use the container after you have emptied the remedy. In case of a liquid agricultural remedy, you must make sure that the container does not spill the remedy when you pour it. Your container must comply with theSouth African National Standards 10229.

The office of the Registrar sends out letters on the renewal and application forms to all registration holders within the three-year cycle.

The application will only be processed on receipt of a full renewal registration application consisting of Form A in triplicate, Form B (if applicable) and Form C in duplicate as well as the relevant registration fee per product..
