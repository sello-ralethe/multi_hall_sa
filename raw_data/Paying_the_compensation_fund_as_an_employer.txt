==================================================

All employers must register with the Compensation Fund and pay an annual assessment fee based on their workers’ earnings and the risks associated with the type of work being done.  Certain employers do not have to pay assessment fees.

Every year in April, the Compensation Fund sends a notice of assessment which stipulates how much you should be paid for the assessment fee.

Fees may increase or decrease according to an employer’s accident costs.  Employers with low costs may qualify for assessment fee rebates.
