==================================================

If you want to sell petroleum products to consumers for end use, you must apply for a wholesale licence from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.

The licence allows you to buy petroleum products in bulk (1 500 litres or more, per transaction of petroleum products) from a licensed manufacturer, and to sell it to end users.

The licence is valid for as long as your business operates.

You should receive a response within 90 days from the date when the Department received proof of publication of the notice of application.
