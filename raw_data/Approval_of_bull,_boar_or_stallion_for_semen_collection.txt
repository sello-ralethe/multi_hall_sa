==================================================

Before collecting genetic material from an animal, you must first get approval from the Registrar: Animal Improvement.

You must take a blood sample of the animal from which you want to collect genetic material. Send the blood sample to a recognised laboratory for DNA testing. The laboratory will issue a DNA profile certificate of the animal. The certificate is required for the animal breeders’ society to confirm the parentage and identity of the animal.

A state veterinarian must examine the animal. Contact a veterinary officer at your provincial department of agriculture. For the animal to be approved as a donor it must be healthy and disease-free. The veterinarian will check the animal’s semen quality and other prescribed requirements. After the examination, the veterinarian will complete and sign the “endorsement” section of the form. Alternatively, you can use a private veterinarian.

Once you have submitted your application, the Registrar and the animal breeders’ society will verify the information supplied by the veterinarian and the profile from the laboratory. If they are satisfied with the information, the Registrar will notify you to arrange for the examination of the animal by a veterinarian, in order to obtain a certificate.

If chromosomal abnormalities occur in a specific breed, the Registrar will ask you to submit a karyotype certificate of clearance. If the Registrar and the animal breeders’ society are not satisfied they will inform you.

Note: If there is more than one animal from which you want to collect genetic material, you must submit a separate application for each animal.

Thirty (30) days.
