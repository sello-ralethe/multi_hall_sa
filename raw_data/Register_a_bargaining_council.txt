==================================================

Trade unions and employers’ organisations may apply to form bargaining councils.

Bargaining councils deal with collective agreements, solve labour disputes, establish various schemes and comment on labour policies and laws.

Send your application for the registration of a bargaining council (Application for Registration of Bargaining Council, Form LRA3.3) to the Registrar of Labour Relations, Department of Labour, Private Bag X117, Pretoria, 0001.

Any bargaining council may also decide to merge or amalgamate with one or more other bargaining councils.  After registering the new council, the registrar cancels each of the separate bargaining councils’ registration.

Send your application for the amalgamation of bargaining councils (Application for Registration of Amalgamated Bargaining Council, LRA3.11) to the Registrar of Labour Relations, Department of Labour, Private Bag X117, Pretoria, 0001.
