==================================================

To export certain goods out of South Africa, you must have a permit ensuring that you comply with applicable export control measures.

The export of some goods may be restricted to support beneficiation strategies or to assist local manufacturers to obtain raw materials before they are exported.

An export permit is required to ensure that goods exported by an individual or organisation comply with the provisions of international agreements. Export permits also help to control the outflow of goods of a strategic nature or smuggled and stolen goods.

The policy that applies to the export of goods differs from sector to sector. If you require policy information regarding the export of specific goods, you should provide the Import and Export Control office at the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) with details of the particular goods you want to export.

Not all goods or products are subject to export control measures.A list of goods that are subject to export control measuresis available from ITAC. It can also can be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to you on request.

The turnaround time for processing an application is two working days on average, with an exception of Export Permits for scrap metals, which take 10 working days for circulation, plus time for processing and issuing.
