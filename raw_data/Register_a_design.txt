Register your design with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) to get exclusive rights to use that design and prevent others from manufacturing, importing or using it.There are two types of designs that you can register: an aesthetic design and a functional design. An aesthetic design has a unique shape, configuration or ornamentation that appeals to the eye. A functional design has a shape or configuration that is necessitated by its function. An aesthetic design is legally protected for 15 years whilst a functional design is protected for 10 years.

You have to renew the registration annually before the expiry of the third year, as from the date of lodgement.
