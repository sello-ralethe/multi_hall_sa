==================================================

Do you wish to offer tertiary (higher) education in South Africa? You must first register as a private higher education institution with the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) to have the legal authority to offer higher education programmes.

Private higher education institutions offer the same National Qualifications Framework (NQF) levels (Levels 5 to 10) as public universities or universities of technology.

The purpose of registration is to ensure that:

The programmes of private institutions must be registered with the DHET, accredited by theHigher Education Quality Committee (HEQC) of the Council on Higher Education (CHE)and registered on the NQF by theSouth African Qualifications Authority (Saqa). The programmes must be recognised nationally as well as internationally.

At least 18 months before your institution wishes to operate you must submit an application for registration to the Registrar of Private Higher Education institutions. An Application for Conversion must be submitted by the date determined by the Registrar (Director-General).

Note: Please contact the Registrar about any changes you wish to make during the application process.
