==================================================

If your close corporation (CC) has grown bigger and you want to compete with bigger companies in the same market, you can convert it into a company at the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC). Converting your CC into a company will enable you to invite other parties to invest as shareholders in your business.

All members of the CC must sign a letter agreeing to convert the CC into a company and become shareholders in the company. If you want to change the CC name, you must reserve a name.

Find out more about converting from a CC to a company from theCompanies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC)or contact CIPC on 086 100 2472.
