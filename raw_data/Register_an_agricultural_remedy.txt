==================================================

To import, manufacture, or sell an agricultural remedy in South Africa, you must be registered with the Registrar of Act 36 of 1947.

You may only qualify for registration if you are a South African citizen or a juristic person with a registered office in South Africa.

If the agricultural remedy that you want to register is already registered by another person, you must get permission from that individual before registration.

You must package the remedy to be registered in a clean and closed container. You are not allowed to re-use the container after you have emptied the remedy. In case of a liquid agricultural remedy, you must make sure that the container does not spill the remedy when you pour it. Your container must comply with the South African National Standards 10229.

Your container must be labelled with:

Six to 12 months.
