For your co-operative to be a legally recognised entity, you must register it at the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC). To register with the Registrar of Co-operatives at CIPC, your group must have five or more members.

A co-operative is a distinct form of enterprise that provides services and/or products to its members. Profits, known as surpluses in a co-operative, are divided among members. Each member will receive a portion of the profits or surplus, depending on the amount of business the member did with the co-operative.
