==================================================

If you want to import controlled or used and second-hand personal or individual goods into South Africa you need permission from the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC).

A list of goods that are subject to import and export control measures is available on theItac website. If you submit your contact details to ITAC, the list can be posted, faxed or e-mailed to you.

It may take up to three days to complete the process

ITAC does not charge any service fees but you will have to pay customs duty to Sars. Customs duty is calculated as a percentage of the value of the goods (set in the schedules to the Customs and Excise Act). For more information on customs duty,visit the Sars website.
