==================================================

TheClothing and Textile Competitiveness Programme (CTCP)aims to build capacity among manufacturers and in other areas of the apparel value chain in South Africa, to enable them to effectively supply their customers and compete on a global scale. Such competitiveness encompasses issues of cost, quality, flexibility, reliability, adaptability and the capability to innovate.

After government set a 100% local content requirement, the clothing, textiles, leather and footwear sector saw the reintroduction of products where local production had been discontinued. These include technical fabrics, protective footwear, protective fabrics and chambray fabrics.

This intervention, supported also by the Clothing and Textile Competitiveness Improvement Programme, has contributed to turning the sector around. In response to the flood of cheap clothing imports, government has increased the import duty on clothing to 45% in line with World Trade Organisation regulations
