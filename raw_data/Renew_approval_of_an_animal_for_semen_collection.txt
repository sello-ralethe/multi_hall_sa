==================================================

Before you may move an animal that you have registered for collection of semen to another centre, you must apply for renewal of the approval of an animal for the collection of semen.You do not need to take blood samples of the animal concerned. You also do not need a veterinarian’s certificate unless you are moving the animal due to foot-and-mouth disease in the area where the animal is kept. However, you must contact the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development and give them reasons why you want to move the animal.
