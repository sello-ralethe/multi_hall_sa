==================================================

To register a trade union, you must apply to the Registrar of Labour Relations at the Department of Employment and Labour.

A trade union is an organisation of workers that promotes and protects the interests of its members in issues such as wages and working conditions, especially through negotiations with employers. Trade unions do not have to be registered with the Department of Labour, but registered unions have additional rights.

Send your application (Registration as a Trade Union, LRA 6.1) to the Registrar of Labour Relations, Department of Employment and Labour, Private Bag X117, Pretoria, 0001.
