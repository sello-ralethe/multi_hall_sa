==================================================

To operate a fish processing establishment (FPE), you must have an FPE permit. You can only apply for an FPE permit when you have a fishing right. Invitation to apply for a fishing right is published in the Government Gazette.

An FPE is a vehicle, vessel, premises, or a place where a substance or article is produced from fish. The substance may be produced by any method, such as cutting up, dismembering, separation of parts, cleaning, sorting, lining, and preserving fish. The establishment also includes a place where fish is canned, packed, dried, gutted, salted, iced, chilled, frozen or processed for sale in or outside South Africa.

The evaluation process will begin after the cut-off date for applications. Upon finalisaton of the process, the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment will announce the results. If granted the FPE right, you must apply for the permit to operate an FPE and satisfy the requirements to get a permit.

The Minister will approve an FPE exemption under exceptional circumstances. If an FPE exemption is granted you must apply for a permit to operate an FPE.

Note: You must renew the permit annually. Failure to adhere to permit conditions may result in the suspension, cancellation or revocation of the permit.
