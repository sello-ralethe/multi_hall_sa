About testing seed for complaint and dispute purposes

If you want to investigate a high level of impurity or poor germination of a seed lot, contact the Directorate Inspection Services (DIS) at the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development to have the seed tested.

The DIS will request that the Official Seed Testing Laboratory (OSTL) investigate your dispute or complaint.

Any person, organisation, institute, company or farmer can lay a complaint or declare a dispute.

What you should do

Contact the DIS and state clearly all information relating to the complaint or dispute.

Complete a complaint application form and send it to the nearest DIS regional office.

The DIS sampler will draw the sample from the seed lot in question and submit it to the OSTL for testing.

If your complaint is justified, i.e. the quality of the seed does not comply with the Plant Improvement Act, 1976 (Act No.53 of 1976), you will not pay. If your complaint is not justified, you will receive an invoice and must pay the prescribed fee.Banking details:Bank: Standard BankBranch name: ArcadiaBranch code: 01-08-45Account number: 011 244887Account name: NDA- Seed Testing Services

You can pay electronically or over the counter.

Remember to include the invoice number for reference purposes. Pay the seed testing tariff and send proof of payment to the OSTL for release of the report.

Note: If the complaint is not justified, the findings of the investigation will only be made available after payment.

How long does it take

The OSTL gives priority to the testing of seed samples for dispute or compliant purposes. The magnitude of the dispute or complaint, i.e. number of samples, crop types and type of tests to be conducted, will affect the time taken for an investigation to be conducted. No service standard information can therefore be provided.
