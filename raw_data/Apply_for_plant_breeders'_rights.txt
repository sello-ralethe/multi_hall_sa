==================================================

A plant breeders’ right is a form of intellectual property right granted to breeders of new plant varieties for protection of their varieties against exploitation without their permission.

If you breed a plant variety and would like to obtain financial reward for your efforts, you must register that variety with the Registrar for Plant Breeders' Rights. Once you have registered a plant variety, it becomes your intellectual property. Any individual breeder or breeding institution may apply for a plant breeder’s right. Foreign breeders can only apply through an agent residing in South Africa.

Plant breeders are only granted rights for kinds of plant that are declared in terms of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act, 1976 (Act 15 of 1976). These are listed in Table 1 of the Regulations.

Please note that as the holder of a plant breeders’ right, you must protect your interests and ensure that the variety is not exploited illegally by any unauthorised person.
